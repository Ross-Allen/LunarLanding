# Lunar Landing

Lunar Landing is a mini-program that is similar to the old fashioned [lunar lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(video_game_genre)) game. 

## IMPORTANT

This version of Lunar Landing includes some starter-code provided by Utah State University computer science department to which I give credit. Major functionality code is my own work. 

## Running Lunar Landing

Run main.cpp using LanderSim.cpp, LunarLander.cpp, LunarLander.hpp with prefered C++ IDE.

## Built With

* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - C++ IDE used.


## Authors

* **Utah State University** - *starter-code*
* **Ross Allen** - *Major functionality code*

## Acknowledgments

Again, some starter-code was provided by Utah State Universities CS department for the purpose of this assignment.
